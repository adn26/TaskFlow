# Prompt Log

This file records all prompt interactions and AI responses used to build and debug the project management app.

---

## Entry 1
**Prompt:**
You are a professional project management app builder. I need you to build a project management app. Choose a tech stack that you are comfortable with.

Step 1: Generate a full authentication system using your comfortable tech stack. Include sign-up, sign-in, JWT-based authentication, password hashing, and role-based access control for Admin, Manager, and Team Member. Provide backend API routes and example database schema.

Step 2: Generate a React component for a Kanban board with draggable columns (To Do, In Progress, Done), tasks with title, description, assignee, due date. Connect it to a backend API for CRUD operations on projects and tasks. Some additional tips for you:

Use libraries like react-beautiful-dnd or dnd-kit for drag-drop. Let the task detail modals and forms be separate. Keep tasks linked to users via API endpoints (/projects/:id/tasks). Step 3: Notifications Goal: In-app alerts for task assignments and upcoming due dates. Add notification functionality in React that shows alerts when a user is assigned a task or a task is due soon. Backend should send events via REST endpoints that the frontend polls every minute. Tips:

You can extend later to WebSockets or Firebase for real-time alerts. For MVP, polling every minute is simple and AI-friendly. Step 4: Project Dashboard Generate a React dashboard using Chart.js to show project completion percentage, tasks per status, and upcoming deadlines. Data should be fetched from backend APIs. Include pie charts, bar charts, or progress bars. Keep the backend endpoints simple.

Step 5: File Attachments & Threaded Comments Generate API routes and React components to upload files to a task and store them locally. Also, create a threaded comment system for tasks with CRUD operations. Limit file types initially to images and PDFs. Threaded comments: simple parent/child relationship in DB.

**Response (Gemini):**
Outlined the full **App Blueprint** with Kanban board, task management, project dashboard, notifications, file attachments, threaded comments, role-based access control, and UI details. Suggested using TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Gemini/Genkit for AI.

## Entry 2
**Prompt:**
Try fixing this error: Runtime Error: ReferenceError: Package is not defi...

**Response (Gemini):**
Identified the missing import of the `Package` icon in the header component. Added the import to fix the error.

---

## Entry 3
**Prompt:**
Try fixing this error: Runtime Error: Error: useChart must be used within...

**Response (Gemini):**
Explained that the chart components were not wrapped in `ChartContainer`. Updated `ProjectCompletionChart` to be wrapped properly, fixing the error.

---

## Entry 4
**Prompt:**
Let's add some functionality to the app, like creating new projects.

**Response (Gemini):**
Added a "New Project" button to the sidebar that opens a form dialog for project creation. Initially used mock data.

---

## Entry 5
**Prompt:**
Well let's implement that. Not just mock data.

**Response (Gemini):**
Proposed switching to Firebase Firestore for real project persistence. Added Firebase configuration, services, and integrated with UI.

---

## Entry 6
**Prompt:**
Try fixing this error: Console Error: [2025-09-30T12:27:03.051Z] @firebas...

**Response (Gemini):**
Explained that Firestore API wasnâ€™t enabled. Directed to enable Firestore API in Google Cloud console and create Firestore database.

---

## Entry 7
**Prompt:**
I need to enable billing for that. Is there any other free alternatives?

**Response (Gemini):**
Suggested replacing Firestore with **localStorage** to avoid billing. Updated services and components to use localStorage.

---

## Entry 8
**Prompt:**
The app isn't starting. Please investigate what could be wrong based on these server logs:
(Logs showing Firestore permission errors)

**Response (Gemini):**
Diagnosed that Firebase code was still being called. Re-applied changes to fully remove Firebase and ensure only localStorage is used.

---

## Entry 9
**Prompt:**
Try fixing this error: Console Error: A param property was accessed direc...

**Response (Gemini):**
Updated Next.js routing to use the new `useParams` hook from `next/navigation`.

---

## Entry 10
**Prompt:**
I can't add a task into To Do / In Progress / Done Kanban board.

**Response (Gemini):**
Implemented a "Create Task" dialog with a form, plus a new localStorage-based task service. Tasks now appear on the board.

---

## Entry 11
**Prompt:**
Add a functionality where users can be assigned to the specific tasks with roles. It does not have to be real users since the app is on testing right now.

**Response (Gemini):**
Added mock users. Updated "Create Task" form with an assignee dropdown. Task cards now display assignee avatar.

---

## Entry 12
**Prompt:**
Implement the comments functionality. The comments should also have threaded comments feature. Just demonstrate with some mock users.

**Response (Gemini):**
Enhanced comment threads with mock data, displayed comment counts on task cards. Initially only display, not interactive.

---

## Entry 13
**Prompt:**
I meant this. The user should be able to send comments. Also input some comments in some existing tasks so threaded comments functionality can be demonstrated.

**Response (Gemini):**
Added full comment service using localStorage. Made threads interactive with form submissions and mock data.

---

## Entry 14
**Prompt:**
I cannot do the threaded replies. Add a button or some kind of option to the comments where the user can reply to the comment hence making the comment "threaded".

**Response (Gemini):**
Added a "Reply" button to each comment. Clicking opens a reply box. Replies now correctly attach to parent comments.

---

## Entry 15
**Prompt:**
Too big of a reply button. The threaded functionality should be like Reddit's threaded comments functionality...

**Response (Gemini):**
Refactored comments into recursive `CommentItem` component. Enabled infinite nested replies (Reddit-style). Made reply button subtle.

---

## Entry 16
**Prompt:**
Ooo slight problem the task card gets bigger and bigger as more comments are added. Let's add a scroll functionality to it to fix that.

**Response (Gemini):**
Wrapped comments in `ScrollArea` with max height. Added scrollbars to prevent dialog from stretching.

---

## Entry 17
**Prompt:**
Now let's work on the in app alerts feature.

**Response (Gemini):**
Confirmed a mock notification system exists. Asked what changes should be prioritized: UI, logic, or dynamic notifications.

---

## Entry 18
**Prompt:**
It just says failed to prioritize notifications and a Next.js error popped up: (503 Service Unavailable from Gemini API)

**Response (Gemini):**
Explained the AI model was overloaded. Improved fallback: if prioritization fails, notifications are shown in default order with warning.
